# FedAvg as a federated optimizer plugin for custom aggregation

## Overview

The `CustomAggregator` extends the `FedOptimizer` class to provide a flexible and efficient mechanism for aggregating model updates in a federated learning environment. This plugin supports Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC), cross-validation, and the aggregation of weights and samples, making it a versatile tool for federated learning scenarios.

## Features

- **Aggregation of Model Weights**: Combines model weights from different clients based on the number of samples contributed by each, ensuring a fair and weighted aggregation.
- **SMPC Support**: Offers the ability to perform secure aggregation, safeguarding the privacy of the participating clients' data during the aggregation process.
- **Cross-Validation Support**: Facilitates the implementation of cross-validation techniques in federated settings to enhance model performance and reliability.
- **Extensible Stopping Criteria**: Allows for the customization of stopping criteria based on metrics or iteration limits, providing flexibility in controlling the training process.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8
- NumPy
- PyTorch (for base classes and utilities)

Ensure these dependencies are installed to use the `CustomAggregator` plugin effectively.

## Installation

No specific installation steps are required other than ensuring the necessary dependencies are installed. Import the `CustomAggregator` class into your federated learning project to utilize its functionality.

## Usage

1. **Initialization**: Instantiate the `CustomAggregator` with the required parameters (if any), such as iteration limits or other optimizer configurations.

```python
from federated_optimizer import CustomAggregator

aggregator = CustomAggregator(max_iter=1000, ...)
```

2. **Aggregation**: Use the `aggregate` method to combine model weights from different clients. This method takes the model parameters from all clients and returns the updated global weights.

```python
global_weights = aggregator.aggregate(client_params)
```

3. **Post-Aggregation**: Optionally, perform any post-aggregation steps, such as evaluating metrics or applying stopping criteria.

```python
aggregator.post_aggregate(metrics=evaluation_metrics)
```

4. **Integration**: Integrate the aggregator into your federated learning training loop, ensuring that model updates are aggregated and applied across training rounds.
